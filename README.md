1. The colab notebook project v1.2 has the full code. it's quite resource(memory and gpu) uitilizing. <br>
2. Projectv2-api uses replicate apis to reduce resource utilization. <br>

We tried to make translator where you can <b>UPLOAD A VIDEO HAVING ANY LANGUAGE TO PRODUCE SAME VIDEO WITH ENGLISH SPEAKING SPEAKER HAVING HIS OWN VOICE WITH LIPSYNC
To make this toolkit.</b> <br>
Or add any others voiceðŸ‘€.<br>

We seriallized these to produce resultant easierðŸ˜‡.<br>
